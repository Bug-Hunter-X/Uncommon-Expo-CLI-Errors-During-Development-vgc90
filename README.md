# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors During Development

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI during development. The error message itself is often vague and unhelpful, making debugging challenging.

The primary cause is related to development environment issues like dependency conflicts, port collisions, or problems with Android/iOS simulators.  This repo provides example code exhibiting the problematic behavior and a solution to resolve it.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run Expo: `expo start` (Observe the error)
4. Apply the solution and rerun `expo start`

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have the correct Node.js and npm versions.
- Check for conflicting packages using `npm ls` or `yarn why`
- Try restarting your computer and cleaning the Expo cache (`expo prebuild --clean`).
- If you're using a simulator, ensure it's properly configured and running.
