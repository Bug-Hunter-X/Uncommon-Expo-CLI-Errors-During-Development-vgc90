The solution involves carefully checking your package.json for conflicting dependencies. In this case, there might be a conflict between the expo and react-native versions that you are using, so, consider using a compatible version of both packages. If the conflict persists, consider cleaning the expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean`, removing the node_modules folder and reinstalling it, or checking for other conflicting packages. Additionally, ensure that you're using a compatible version of expo-cli.
